It leverages path-based ownership for user data, ensuring secure access and simple security rules. The `/users/{userId}/profile` collection stores each user's profile information, identified by their unique Firebase Authentication UID. This approach achieves Authorization Independence, as access control is directly tied to the path and the authenticated user's ID (`request.auth.uid`), eliminating the need for `get()` calls in security rules. The email is denormalized into the profile to support username-based login flows. All documents in the `profile` subcollection share the same security requirements: only the authenticated user can read or write their own profile, simplifying the security posture."
