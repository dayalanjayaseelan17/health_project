# **App Name**: Swasthya Margdarshan

## Core Features:

- Simple Welcome Screen: Display a welcoming landing page with a clear title and a prominent 'Start' button for easy navigation to the core content.
- One-Tap Navigation: Implement JavaScript-based navigation that directs users to the details.html page upon tapping the 'Start' button, ensuring a seamless transition.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Light green (#A7D9A5) to evoke a sense of health and nature.
- Background color: Very light green (#F0FAF0) providing a clean and calming backdrop.
- Accent color: A slightly darker, but analogous, green (#86C475) to draw attention to key interactive elements.
- Font: 'PT Sans' for body and headline text; it's a humanist sans-serif offering both a modern look and a touch of warmth, which is essential for users with varying levels of digital literacy.
- The 'Start' button is centered vertically and horizontally to make it the focal point. The button should be large and easily tappable on mobile devices, and large fonts improve readability for users with lower digital literacy.
- A health-related icon, such as a medical cross or heart, will be used subtly to reinforce the app's theme, displayed simply without being obtrusive.
- No complex animations will be used to keep the interface simple and straightforward.
